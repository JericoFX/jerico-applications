# FX-APPLICATION

This resource helps with the need to open and close applications by creating an npc that can be interacted with.
The same resource comes with a command to open and close the applications, the command is "application", it takes as its argument 0 to open the applications or 1 to close the applications, when you open the applications a message is sent through the chat to everyone the players notifying the availability.
When a player creates a form it is sent via Discord.
At the moment only admins can open and close applications.
In the Shared folder you will find 2 files, server.lua that manages the webhook and shared.lua that manages the job, the npc and its coordinates.
PS: The admin must be at work to open or close applications.
